# AMLS_assignment19_20

All files required for my code to run are in the file 'AMLS_19-20_SN16057914'. Inside will be a main.py that simply needs to be run - it will use the other python files that I have created in this folder (such as preprocess_B and so on). 


There is also a folder named 'Datasets' that is empty on this Github as the file is too large but shows that this is how I want the Datasets folder placed in 'AMLS_19-20_SN16057914'. I provide a Google Drive link to download the Datasets folder with the data and labels named in the way I refer to them in my code. It's important that this Dataset folder is downloaded and placed in the 'AMLS_19-20_SN16057914' folder for my code to work.
